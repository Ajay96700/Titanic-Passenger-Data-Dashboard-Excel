![]()

## Hereâ€™s what I did:
- Explored the data columns â€” pclass, survived, sex, age, fare, embarked, and more.
- Leveraged ChatGPT to help me quickly understand the data file and its fields (see screenshots attached!).
- Applied data validation and cleaning to ensure accuracy.
- Built a visually appealing Excel dashboard using Donut charts, Column charts, and a Treemap for intuitive insight sharing.

## Key insights included:
 - Total passengers, overall fare & average fare
 - Gender & Age distributions
